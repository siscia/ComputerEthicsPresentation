# Technophiles should Participate the Political Process

# The old days

No much interest in technologies.

Considered just a game.

2. MUCH more political interest.

#VSLIDE

* USA Election.
* WikiLeaks.
* ...

#VSLIDE

Not a well diffuse understanding of the repercusion of such political interest.

Extreme surveillance' becomes UK law with **barely a whimper**, The Guardian, 19 November 2016 [1]

#HSLIDE

# Governments

Governments are getting more and more interested in regulate / control technologies.

#HSLIDE

Good BUT must be done in the correct way.

#VSLIDE

A bill giving the UK intelligence agencies and police **the most sweeping surveillance powers in the western world** has passed into law with barely a whimper, **meeting only token resistance** over the past 12 months from inside parliament and **barely any** from outside.

The Investigatory Powers Act, passed on Thursday, legalizes a whole range of tools for **snooping and hacking** by the __security services__ unmatched by any other country in western Europe or even the US.

#VSLIDE

Decision must be taken by **educated** people.

#HSLIDE

#How can we react?

#HSLIDE

1. IGNORE The Issue
2. FIGHT
3. PARTICIPATE

#HSLIDE

# IGNORE The Issue
Let the political process flow without getting interested.

#VSLIDE

Political authorities **DO NOT** have the KNOWLEDGE to write good laws.

It is not their job.

#VSLIDE 

Do we care?

#VSLIDE

I do not **actively** care about all the laws about, just to name something, food safety.

#VSLIDE

However, I do not have any knowledge about food safety, but I do know a lot about technology. 

#VSLIDE

Yes, I believe we should at least care.

#VSLIDE

## If we ignore the issues

We will be prey of companies that are lobbying our parliaments.

#VSLIDE

Amount of money spent in lobbying the US parliament.

* AT&T Inc	$12,660,000
* Alphabet Inc	$11,850,000
* Compact Corp	$10,510,000
* Exxon Mobil	$8,840,000
* Amazon.com 	$8,624,000

#VSLIDE

It is ethical to have the law that we, our parents and the whole population have to respect been designed without the input of the expert on the issues but with the input of companies?

> I don't think so.

#HSLIDE

# FIGHT

Use the technologies we master circumnavigate the laws we **don't like**.

#VSLIDE

* We still live in a physically world, law enforcement apply to us as well.

#VSLIDE

* What would be the line between an "ethical hacker" and an "unethical cracker" ? And that line does have any meaning anyway?

> Aaron Swartz

#HSLIDE

# PARTICIPATE

Use the technology we master to shape the democratic process in order to educate the less tech savvy and the policy maker.

Create the condition to have an educate discussion about important subject.

#VSLIDE

# It is possible ?

#VSLIDE

> We had just 72 hours to create a digital and branding strategy for the launch, including a website, email and fundraising program and digital advertising strategy. Within 24 hours of Bernie's announcement, we raised over $1.5 million.

#VSLIDE

What that actually means?

#VSLIDE

Not necessary to go as far as political activism, but it is sufficient to explain what are the re-percussion of a particular law on your less tech-educated friend.

#VSLIDE

## BUT... !

#VSLIDE

It is hard to do!

#VSLIDE

No, it is not. Mastering engineering means mastering abstraction and communication. It is not necessary to explain EVERYTHING.

#VSLIDE

I hope to have show my point, on the ethical necessity of being involved in the political process as technophiles.

# Question?
